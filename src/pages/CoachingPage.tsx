            <p>
              Traditional talk therapy often scratches the surface. Somatic coaching, as I practice it, delves deeper. We work with the body's wisdom to access and heal the root causes of distress, attachment wounds, and trauma. It's about feeling the unfelt, nurturing your inner "wise parent," and cultivating a profound sense of safety and aliveness within.

              Clients typically experience significant shifts within the first 3 months, though many choose to continue this transformative work longer-term, viewing me as a trusted life advisor.
